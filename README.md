# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: Projects and Code

## Description

This repository contains code and projects developed while working through the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido. It aims to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning concepts and algorithms using Python.

## Contents

Projects:
### 1.1 Classifying IRIS Species Using KNN Model 
This code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. It loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, trains the KNN model, and evaluates its performance on unseen data. The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test set
### 2. Linear / Ridge and Lasso Regression for Boston Housing Data
### 3.
