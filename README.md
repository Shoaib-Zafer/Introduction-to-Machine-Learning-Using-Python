# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: Projects and Code

## Description

This repository contains code and projects developed while working through the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido. It aims to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning concepts and algorithms using Python.

## Projects:

### 1.1 Classifying IRIS Species Using KNN Model 
This code implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. It loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, trains the KNN model, and evaluates its performance on unseen data. The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test set
### 1.2 Analyzing KNeighbors Classifer in KNN Model
This code investigates the impact of varying K values in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. It trains a KNN model on the breast cancer dataset and evaluates its accuracy on both training and testing data for different K values (number of neighbors). The results are visualized in a plot to identify the optimal K value that balances model complexity and accuracy
### 1.3 Linear / Ridge and Lasso Regression for Boston Housing Data
This code implements and compares linear regression and ridge regression models for predicting house prices. It first uses linear regression to learn a model from the Boston Housing dataset, then evaluates its performance on a separate test set.Ridge regression is then introduced to address overfitting, a common problem in linear regression. The code demonstrates how ridge regression achieves better generalization on unseen data by penalizing complex models
### 1.4 Lasso Regression and Significan of Alpha 
This Python code implements Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning for Boston housing price prediction. It evaluates model performance on both training and test sets under different alpha values, revealing the impact of regularization on feature selection and accuracy
